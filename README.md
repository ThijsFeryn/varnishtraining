# Varnish training

## Depencencies

These exercises depend on [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [Virtualbox](http://www.virtualbox.org). Depending on your system, you might need to download [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org). And don't forget to install [Git](http://git-scm.com), otherwise you can't clone this repo to your computer.

## Setup

If your internet connection is fast enough, Vagrant will automatically download the base box and set up the machine.

1.  `vagrant up`
2.  Add `10.10.10.6 varnishtraining.dev` to your hosts file
3.  Go to [http://varnishtraining.dev:8080](http://varnishtraining.dev:8080) to continue
